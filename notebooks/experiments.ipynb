Never attempt to lift the motor by the power cords.\\n2. Be sure the motor is stored shaft down until ready to install.\\n\\n1-2\\n\\nMN414\\n\\x0cSection 2\\nInstallation & Operation\\n\\nOverview  \\n\\nCaution:  \\n\\nInstallation should conform to the National Electrical Code as well as local codes and practices.\\nAll BaldorReliance Submersible Pump Motors Include thermal devices as standard. Normally, there are four \\nconditions during which a submersible sewage pump may be operated in gases or vapors.\\n1.   When the wet well is being dewatered.\\n2.   When the pump motor assembly is being lowered down the guide rails. The flow from the pump is needed \\nduring the installation process to ensure that solids are cleared from the discharge flange area to ensure \\nproper seating.\\n\\n3.   When low−level cutoff controls fail.\\n4.   When low−level sensors are positioned at the bottom of the pump assembly.\\nContinuous Operation Gasses Or Vapors\\nBe sure you have selected the correct motor for your application. The horsepower rating of the motor is \\ndetermined by the pump design, impeller size & head and flow conditions. \\nOperating time is a function of pit size, pump capacity, and flow conditions. Only the pump manufacturer can \\nensure that the pump motor is properly applied for continuous in−gas or vapor operation. As with any motor \\nproduct, it is essential that proper consideration be given to the load characteristics to ensure the motor will not \\nbe overloaded. Should such an overload occur, thermostats embedded in the windings will provide a signal to \\ndeenergize the motor. However, proper consideration of the application will prevent such an overload.\\nLift using Lift Eyes only. Lifting by power cords will cause motor damage. Use spreader bar to evenly \\ndistribute lift force. Angle of lift rope (no spreader bar) should not exceed 45° from vertical, excessive lift \\nangle can damage motor.\\n\\nFigure 2-1   \\n\\nLevel 2\\n\\n45(cid:31) \\nMaximum\\n\\nLift Methods\\n\\nPreferred Lift\\nMethod\\n\\nSpreader \\nBar\\n\\nLift Eye\\n\\nPump \\nMotor\\n\\nLevel 1\\nBelow Level 1\\n\\nAlternate Method if Water Jacket equipped\\n\\nDo not lift submersible motor by the water\\njacket.\\nUse lifting straps at front and back end\\nbrackets as shown.\\n\\nWater Jacket\\n\\nThe following load conditions should be noted, refer to Figure 2-1:\\n1.   Below Level 1 (below the pump) fluid is not pumped and no load is reflected to the motor.\\n2.   One pump should always be sized sufficiently large to draw the well down (even under maximum flow \\n\\nconditions). The maximum amount of time the motor will operate fully loaded and uncovered is the amount of \\ntime required to draw the well down from Level 2 (top of the motor) to the bottom of the pump.\\n\\n3.   Time described in 2 should not be greater than 15 minutes.\\n4.   These notes do not make allowance for the following:\\n\\na.   The heat exchanger effect of the attached pump. It is pumping a relatively cool fluid and will remove \\n\\nsome heat.\\n\\nb.   The motor does not operate fully loaded completely in gas. It is fully loaded as the motor is being \\n\\nc.  \\n\\nuncovered.\\n!f the well is being drawn down from the top of the motor and the maximum flow conditions exist, the \\ninfluent flow will usually provide excellent cooling of the pump motor.\\n\\n2-1\\n\\nMN414\\n\\x0cWARNING:  \\n\\nWARNING:  \\n\\nInstallation  \\n\\nDo not touch electrical connections before you first ensure that power has been disconnected. Electrical \\nshock can cause serious or fatal injury. Only qualified personnel should attempt the installation, operation \\nand maintenance of this equipment.\\nThe Adjustable Speed Controller may apply hazardous voltages to the motor leads after power to the \\ncontroller has been turned off. Verify that the controller is incapable of delivering hazardous voltages and \\nthat the voltage at the motor leads is zero before proceeding. Failure to observe this precaution may result \\nin severe bodily injury or death.\\n\\nWhen the submersible pump motor leaves the factory it is ready for installation. No adjustment,  venting or oil \\nfilling is required.\\nConsiderations\\n1.   The user must select a motor starter and over−current protection suitable for this motor and Its application. \\n\\nConsult motor starter application data as well as the National Electric Code and/or other local codes.\\n2.   Maximum submergence of motor is not to exceed 160 ft (49m) in depth and or 100 PSI (690 kpas) at the \\n\\nexternal motor seal for Tandem Seal designs. For slurry seal designs the maximum external motor seal \\npressure is 15 PSI (103 kpas).\\n\\n3.   Thermal Protectors must be connected. Leads marked P1 and P2 (See Figure 2-2).\\n4.   Moisture Sensing Probes must be connected. Leads marked W1 and W2. (See Figure 2-3).\\n5.   Check your power supply against final nameplate connection voltage.\\n6.   Motor will operate properly with frequency not more than +5% and voltage not more than +10% above or \\n\\nbelow nameplate rating.\\n\\n7.   Performance within this range will not necessarily be the same as the established performance at exact rated \\n\\nvoltage and frequency.\\n\\n8.   For three phase motors only: To reverse direction of a three phase motor, interchange any two motor lead \\n\\nconnections at the starter.\\n\\nInstallation Procedure\\nTo prevent damage to the motor, do not use force to drive pump on (drive impeller onto motor shaft) or to remove \\npump from motor shaft.\\n1.   Turn off and lockout all power and verify the voltage at the motor starter connectors are zero.\\n2.   Connect the motor power leads to the connectors in the motor starter. (See “Grounding”).\\n\\nNote: The motor lead cable assembly for all Submersible Pump Motors has 3 marked power leads plus two ground \\n\\nleads, two thermal leads and two moisture sensing probe leads.\\n\\n3.   Three Phase Motors ONLY.\\n\\na.   Turn off and lockout all power and verify the voltage at the motor starter connectors are zero.\\nb.   Be sure the motor shaft is disconnected from the load and will not cause mechanical rotation of the \\n\\nmotor shaft.\\n\\nc.   Remove all unused shaft keys and loose rotating parts to prevent them from flying off.\\nd.   Momentarily apply power and check the direction of rotation of the motor shaft.\\n  Motors are designed for bi−directional shaft rotation. When voltages in an A−B−C phase sequence are \\napplied to leads U/T1, V/T2, W/T3 clockwise shaft rotation facing the opposite drive end will result.  \\nIf shaft rotation is incorrect, change the direction of rotation as follows:\\ni. Turn off and lockout all power and verify that the voltage at the motor leads is zero.\\nii. Reverse any two of three motor power leads at the motor starter.\\niii. Restore power and verify correct rotation.\\niv. Turn off and lockout all power and verify that the voltage at the motor leads is zero.\\n\\n4.   Connect the two Thermal Protectors at the motor starter as shown in Figure 2-2.\\n5.   Connect the two Moisture Sensing Probes at the motor starter as shown in Figure 2-3.\\n6.   Follow pump manufacturer’s instructions and mount the pump on the motor shaft.\\n7.   Secure the pump case to the motor flange.\\n8.   Attach drain piping to pump.\\n9.   Use spreader bar and lifting eyes (see Figure 2-1) to lower the motor/pump assembly to the proper depth.  \\n\\nBe sure that motor wires are not damaged (contact with metal objects etc.)\\n10.  Set control parameter values (if applicable) according to motor nameplate values.\\n\\n2-2\\n\\nMN414\\n\\x0cGrounding  \\n\\nIn the USA consult the National Electrical Code, Article 430 for information on grounding of motors and \\ngenerators, and Article 250 for general information on grounding. In making the ground connection, the installer \\nshould make certain that there is a solid and permanent metallic connection between the ground point, the motor \\nor generator terminal housing, and the motor or generator frame. In non−USA locations consult the appropriate \\nnational or local code applicable.\\nMotors with resilient cushion rings usually must be provided with a bonding conductor across the resilient \\nmember. Some motors are supplied with the bonding conductor on the concealed side of the cushion ring to \\nprotect the bond from damage. Motors with bonded cushion rings should usually be grounded at the time of \\ninstallation in accordance with the above recommendations for making ground connections. When motors \\nwith bonded cushion rings are used in multimotor installations employing group fusing or group protection, the \\nbonding of the cushion ring should be checked to determine that it is adequate for the rating of the branch circuit \\nover current protective device being used.\\nThere are applications where grounding the exterior parts of a motor or generator may result in greater hazard by \\nincreasing the possibility of a person in the area simultaneously contacting ground and some other nearby live \\nelectrical parts of other ungrounded electrical equipment. In portable equipment it is difficult to be sure that a \\npositive ground connection is maintained as the equipment is moved, and providing a grounding conductor may \\nlead to a false sense of security.\\nSelect a motor starter and over current protection suitable for this motor and its application. Consult motor starter \\napplication data as well as the National Electric Code and/or other applicable local codes.  Adjustable Frequency \\nPower Inverters used to supply adjustable frequency power to induction motors produce wave forms with lower \\norder harmonics with voltage spikes superimposed. Turn−to−turn, phase−to−phase, and ground insulation of \\nstator windings are subject to the resulting dielectric stresses.\\nSuitable precautions should be taken in the design of these drive systems to minimize the magnitude of these \\nvoltage spikes. Consult the drive instructions for maximum acceptable motor lead lengths, and proper grounding.\\n\\nThermal Protection\\n\\nThermostat leads marked P1 & P2 must be connected in series with the stop button of the 3−wire pilot circuit \\nof the magnetic motor controller, so that the thermostat will open the circuit before dangerous temperatures are \\nreached. Thermostats are automatic reset for use in a normally closed circuit where the thermostat is connected \\nIn series with the holding coil of the magnetic starter. Thermostats provide “Over Temperature” Protection in \\naccordance with NEMA MG 1−12.53. Thermostats do not provide winding over temperature protection (locked \\nrotor). It is suggested that over current protection be used in the motor starter to ensure locked rotor protection.\\n\\nFigure 2-2  Thermal Protection Circuit\\n\\nStop\\n\\nStart\\n\\nStarter\\n\\nT1 T2 T3\\n\\nGND\\n\\nP2\\n\\nP1\\n\\nMotor\\n\\nAC Line\\n\\nL1\\nL2\\nL3\\nGND\\n\\nVolts\\nAC\\n110-120\\n220-240\\n440-480\\n550-600\\n\\nContinuous \\nAmps\\n3.0\\n1.5\\n0.75\\n0.6\\n\\nInrush \\nAmps\\n30\\n15\\n7.5\\n6.0\\n\\nP1 & P2 N.C.

The cable cap assembly prevents moisture from wicking through the cable assembly \\neven when the cable jacket has been punctured.\\nDual moisture sensing probes extend into the oil chamber located between the tandem mechanical seals.  Should \\nthe outer seal fail, water will enter the oil chamber through the labyrinth slinger paths and create a water/oil \\nemulsion in the oil chamber. The moisture detector control applies voltage to the moisture probes.  \\nThe presence of water in the oil chamber increases the conductivity sufficiently to increase current flow \\nthrough the probe circuit. A leakage detector control such as Ametek APT Series 8040MD Moisture Detector \\n(or equivalent) must be purchased separately. The leakage detector control system must be connected for the \\nwarranty and the U/L listing to be valid.\\nThe connection diagram for the Ametek APT device is shown in Figure 2-3.\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n  Failure to properly connect and use this leakage detector system voids motor warranty.\\n\\nFigure 2-3  Moisture Sensing Circuit\\n\\nAC Line\\n\\nModel 8040MDXYZ\\nAmetek APT\\n800-635-0289\\n248-435-0700\\nwww.ametekapt.com\\n\\nTo\\nAlarm\\n\\nW1\\n\\nW2\\n\\n330k\\n\\nMotor\\n\\nMoisture Sensors\\n\\nControl Cable Lead Color\\n\\nBlack\\n\\nWhite\\n\\nP1\\n\\nP2\\n\\nRed\\n\\nW1\\n\\nOrange Green\\n\\nW2\\n\\nGround\\n\\nNote:   For all physical, electrical, price, warranty and other information about the moisture detector or relay, please \\n\\ncontact the manufacturer directly.\\n\\n2-4\\n\\nMN414\\n\\x0cWARNING:  \\n\\nWARNING:  \\n\\nWARNING:  \\n\\nWARNING:  \\n\\nSurface temperatures of motor enclosures may reach temperatures which can cause discomfort or injury \\nto personnel accidentally coming into contact with hot surfaces. Protection should be provided by the user \\nto protect against accidental contact with hot surfaces. Failure to observe this precaution could result in \\nbodily injury.\\nDo not touch electrical connections before you first ensure that power has been disconnected.  \\nElectrical shock can cause serious or fatal injury. Only qualified personnel should attempt the installation, \\noperation and maintenance of this equipment.\\nDisconnect all electrical power from the motor windings and accessory devices before disassembly of the \\nmotor. Electrical shock can cause serious or fatal injury.\\nBe sure the system is properly grounded before applying power. Do not apply AC power before you ensure \\nthat all grounding instructions have been followed. Electrical shock can cause serious or fatal injury. \\nNational Electrical Code and Local codes must be carefully followed.\\n\\nOperation  \\n\\nDuring operation, observe the motors performance. It should run smoothly with little noise.\\n\\nNote: Never operate these type 21 seals in a dry-run condition.\\n\\nIf moisture infiltrates the motor, the moisture detector circuit will activate.\\nIf the motor overheats, the Thermal Protection circuit will activate.\\n\\nMotor operation may stop for one of the following trip conditions:\\n1.  \\n2.  \\n3.   Other condition detected by motor starter (over current, over voltage, etc. if equipped)\\nUnbalanced voltage or single--phase operation of poly phase motor may cause excessive heating and ultimate \\nfailure. Only a slight unbalance of voltage applied to a poly phase motor will cause large unbalanced currents and \\nresultant overheating. Periodic checks of phase voltage, frequency and power consumption of a motor (measured \\nat the motor starter) while in operation are recommended; such checks assure the correctness of frequency and \\nvoltage applied to the motor and yield an indication of the load offered by the apparatus which the motor drives.\\nComparisons of this data with previous no load and full--load power demands will give an indication of the \\nperformance of the complete machine. Any serious deviations should be investigated and corrected.\\nIf a problem with the motor occurs, contact your Baldor District Office for repair.\\nShould the lead connector assembly be damaged or the integrity of the encapsulation be in question, it is \\nrequired that a replacement lead connector assembly be ordered from Baldor, contact your Baldor District Office. \\nRenewal instructions will be provided with the replacement parts.\\n\\nLubrication \\n\\nNew Baldor submersible motors ship with the oil reservoir properly filled with lubricant. Care should be taken \\nwhen handling motor to ensure no damage occurs that allows lubricant to leak from motor.\\nMaintenance should only be performed by qualified motor repair facility due to the water tight construction of this \\nmotor. Ceramic and other seals are easily damaged and special tools are required for service.\\nRecommended lubricant is Shell Rotella 10 SAE 10W.\\nThe appropriate amount of lubricant is given in Table 2−1.\\n\\nTable 2-1  Oil Amount by Frame Size\\n\\nFrame Size\\n\\nOil Spec\\n\\nQuantity\\n\\nMin.

This tag states \\nthe UL certification rating along with the voltage and current rating at the stated \\nambient temperature. The tag also states the Tightening Torque for the connection nut.\\n\\nFigure 3-1  Thermal Protection Circuit\\n\\nTo insure the cable is properly mated to the receptacle, the receptacle has a notch and \\nthe cable insert has a pro-trusion that will align with the notch. \\n\\nFigure 3-2  Receptacle notch for mating with the cable\\n\\n3-1\\n\\nMN414\\n\\x0cFigure 3-3  Cable receptacle\\n\\nInsert the cable into the receptacle. Insure that the protrusion on the cable lines up with the receptacle notch. \\nInsert the cable and make sure the cable is fully inserted. \\n\\nThe cable should bottom out inside the receptacle.\\n\\nFigure 3-4  Set screw, nut and cable\\n\\nMake sure the set screw on the nut is backed out so it will not scratch the cable. Slide the nut into \\nplace and turn the nut counter-clockwise (loosening direction) until you feel and hear (you will hear \\na click) the threads mesh. This will insure that no cross-threading will occur when tightening the nut. \\nTighten the nut by hand and then use a wrench until the proper tightening torque is achieved. The \\nproper tightening torque is stated on the tag attached to the cable. Once the nut is properly tightened, \\ntighten the set screw to prevent the nut from loosening.\\n\\n3-2\\n\\nMN414\\n\\x0c3-3\\n\\nMN414\\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c—\\nABB Motors and Mechanical Inc.\\n5711 R.S.
